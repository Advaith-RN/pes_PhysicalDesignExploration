## Extraction of LEF

**Place and Route (PnR) Process Overview:**

PnR is performed using an abstract view of GDS (Graphic Data System) files generated by Magic. This abstract view includes crucial information such as metal layers and pin placements. 
The PnR tool utilizes this abstract view, formally defined as LEF (Library Exchange Format) information, to facilitate interconnect routing, in coordination with routing guides generated during the PnR flow.

**LEF Information:**

1. **Technology LEF:**
   - Contains essential layer information, via specifications, and restricted Design Rule Check (DRC) rules for the technology.

2. **Cell LEF:**
   - Provides an abstract representation of standard cells.

**Guidelines for Standard Cell Set Generation from a PnR Perspective:**

- Input and output ports must align with the intersection of vertical and horizontal tracks.
- The width of the standard cell should be an odd multiple of the track pitch, while the height should be an odd multiple of the vertical track pitch.

These guidelines are essential to ensure the proper placement and routing of standard cells within the chip design.
