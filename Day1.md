# Inception of Open Source EDA, Openlane and Skywater130

To run openlane, we run a docker container that contains a custom image.
Navigate to the openlane directory and run:
```
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
```

We must first import the openlane 0.9 package. This is simple enough, and can be achieved by running ```package require openlane 0.9```.
