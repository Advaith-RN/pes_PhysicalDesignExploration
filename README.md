# Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130



## ASIC design requires 3 components:
- **RTL (Register-Transfer Level)** ```github.com, opencores.org, librecores.org```
  - RTL serves as a level of abstraction in digital design and electronics. It describes a system's behavior in terms of registers, logic gates, and the flow of data between them.

- **PDK (Process Design Kit)** ```Qflow, OpenRoad, OpenLane```
  - The Process Design Kit is a comprehensive collection of files, libraries, and documentation provided by semiconductor foundries. It serves as a guiding resource for designers in creating integrated circuits (ICs) compatible with a specific manufacturing process. PDKs encompass vital information on design rules, device models, and technology files essential for the design and simulation of ICs.

- **EDA (Electronic Design Automation)** ```Skywater```:
  - Electronic Design Automation tools are specialized software tools used for designing and testing electronic systems, including ICs and PCBs.
